# Workflow: Pre-Push Quality Gate

> **Model routing (do first):** see [`../model-routing.md`](../model-routing.md). Final review
> judgement → frontier tier; the static-analysis *fixes* it produces → workhorse tier.

**Mandatory before every push.** The slash-command form is
[`/pre-push`](../commands/pre-push.md); the full local sweep is
[`/qa`](../commands/qa.md).

The [`sonar-pre-push`](../hooks/sonar-pre-push.sh) hook enforces the SonarQube half of this
automatically — it is a gate, not a reminder.

## Steps (stop and fix on the first hard failure)

```bash
# 1. Understand the change
git status
git diff --stat

# 2. Build, lint, and test
npm ci
npx nx run-many -t lint test build && npm run typecheck
npx nx e2e web-e2e                     # when a route or journey changed
npm audit --audit-level=high

# 3. Secrets
gitleaks detect --no-banner --redact

# 4. SonarQube
npx nx run-many -t test --coverage
sonar-scanner \
  -Dsonar.projectKey="$SONAR_PROJECT_KEY" \
  -Dsonar.host.url="$SONAR_HOST_URL" \
  -Dsonar.token="$SONAR_TOKEN" \
  -Dsonar.sources=apps,libs \
  -Dsonar.javascript.lcov.reportPaths='coverage/*/lcov.info'
```

Never add `sonar.branch.name` or `sonar.pullrequest.*` to that scanner call. This boilerplate
targets **SonarQube Community Build**, which analyses one branch — the default branch — and
rejects both. Branch and pull-request analysis start at Developer Edition.

## Reading the SonarQube result

Prefer the SonarQube MCP tools:

- `get_project_quality_gate_status`
- `search_sonar_issues_in_projects` filtered to `BLOCKER,CRITICAL,MAJOR`
- `search_security_hotspots`

Call each with **no `branch` and no `pullRequest` argument**. Omitting both queries the
default-branch analysis, which on Community Build is the only one there is.

**There is no pull-request decoration.** Sonar findings will never appear as PR comments —
that is a paid-edition feature this repository does not use. This local gate is what catches
them, before the code ever leaves the machine; CI re-analyses the default branch after merge.
See [`../standards/sonarqube.md`](../standards/sonarqube.md).

## Gate rule

- **Any open Blocker / Critical / Major → the push is BLOCKED.** Fix, rerun build and tests,
  rerun the scanner, repeat until zero remain.
- Coverage on new code ≥80%.
- Minor / Info → triage and record; not blocking.
- **Never suppress an issue to pass the gate** without explicit approval and a recorded reason.

## Documentation check

Before declaring the gate green, confirm the docs caught up: the OpenAPI snapshot in
`docs/api/`, a new ADR in `docs/adr/` if a decision was made, and `CLAUDE.md` if a convention
changed. The [`session-handoff`](../hooks/session-handoff.sh) hook flags this drift — read its
report rather than ignoring it.

## After the gate is green

1. Produce a gate report: git status, lint/typecheck/test/build results, E2E result, dependency
   audit, secret scan, SonarQube status, remaining risks.
2. Suggest a commit message.
3. **Ask the user for explicit approval to push.** Approval is per-push and non-transferable —
   see [`../standards/git-approval-policy.md`](../standards/git-approval-policy.md).
